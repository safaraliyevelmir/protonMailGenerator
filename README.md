# ProtonMail Generator - An Email Generator

## Introduction

ProtonMail Generator is a tool designed to help you generate ProtonMail email addresses easily. ProtonMail is known for its security features, but sometimes it can block certain IP addresses, making it difficult to use email verification. In such cases, you can either use a proxy or attempt to bypass captcha using the 2captcha API. This tool uses an undetectable Chrome driver, although it may not be completely foolproof.

## Why selenium

Unlike some other methods that depend on specific software packages or libraries, ProtonMail Generator relies on Selenium. Selenium is a tool that works well across different types of computers and operating systems. By choosing Selenium, we aim to provide a more dependable and cross-platform solution for generating ProtonMail email addresses. This makes it easier for users to access and use the tool on their preferred computer system.
