# ProtonMail Generator - An Email Generator

## Introduction

ProtonMail Generator is a tool designed to help you generate ProtonMail email addresses easily. ProtonMail is known for its security features, but sometimes it can block certain IP addresses, making it difficult to use email verification. In such cases, you can either use a proxy or attempt to bypass captcha using the 2captcha API. This tool uses an undetectable Chrome driver, although it may not be completely foolproof.

## How to Use

Follow these steps to use the ProtonMail Generator:

1. **Create and Activate an Environment**: Before getting started, create a virtual environment for your project and activate it. 

2. **Install Required Packages**: Once your environment is activated, install the necessary Python packages by running: pip install -r requirements.txt

3. **Run the Main Script**: Now you're ready to generate ProtonMail email addresses. Execute the `main.py` script: python main.py
